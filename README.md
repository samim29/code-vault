# code-vault

Welcome to **Code-vault** – a personal repository where I document my journey of learning different tech stacks and concepts. From Web Development to Machine Learning and everything in between, this repo is a collection of code snippets, mini-projects, notes, and experiments I’ve worked on while leveling up my skills.

## 🚀 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
- 📘 To keep track of everything I learn while exploring new technologies.
- 💡 To build a reference library I can revisit whenever needed.
- 🧪 To experiment with small ideas and practice what I learn.
- 🌱 To see how far I've come over time!


## 🛠️ Tech Stacks I'm Exploring
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MySQL, etc.)
- Machine Learning (Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- SQL
- More to come...

## 🧠 Note

This repository is not meant to be a polished portfolio but rather a learning journal. Feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute if you'd like!

Happy coding! ✨
